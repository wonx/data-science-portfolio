 # data-science-portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

- [Film recommender system](film-recommender-system): example of a recommender system, used to provide suggestions for items that better a particular use and predict their preferences. In this example, the recommender system is used to suggest movies to a particular user, based on the overall movie ratings and the taste of similar-minded users. *Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.*
- [Data bootstrapping](data-bootstrapping): (chromosome length)

- Machine learning:
  - [Linear regression](ecommerce-linear-regression/Main.ipynb) (e-commerce dataset): Example of the use of a Linear Regression Model to predict sales based on numerical data on a simulated E-commerce setting. *Tools: Python, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Sklearn and Jupyter Notebook.*
  - [Logistic regression](advertising-logistic-regression/Main.ipynb) (advertising dataset): Using a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether or not a user would click on an ad based on a series of features related to how a user browsed the company website. *Tools: Python, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Sklearn and Jupyter Notebook.*
  - [K-Nearest-Neighbors](KNearestNeighbors-project/Main.ipynb) (KNN-project-data dataset): Using the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm, we create a model to predict a binary categorical variable based on a series of numerical features. *Tools: Python, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Sklearn and Jupyter Notebook.*
  - [Binary category assignment]() (titanic dataset)
  - [Neural Network]() (lending club dataset)
- [K-means clustering](chromosomesize-kmeans-clustering/Main.ipynb) (chromosome length): Determining the most appropiate way to cluster mice chromosomes according to their lengh, so they can be easily identified in the absence of other variables. *Tools: R, ggplot2, Jupyter Notebook.*
